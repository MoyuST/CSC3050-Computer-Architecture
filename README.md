# CSC3050 Computer Architecture

This is my favorite course during my university life at CUHK(SZ).
This course kind of is the first CSC course introduce me to some real coding.
<br>
I still remembered how struggling it is to do the homework: I always started doing each assignment once it released and working on it for three whole weeks till the last sec.
But I always handled each of them just right before the DDLüòÇ.
<br>
I really appreciated all the help I received from my friends at that time which really saved my life.
<br>
To make the new CSC students' lives easier, I decided to share my codes with you! Hope it can give you some links.
<br>
If you do find it helpful, plz gives me a starüëç!
<br>
The assignments and my scores for them are:

- MIPS Assembler (100/100)
- MPIS Simulator (100/100)
- ALU (100/100)
- pipeline CPU (with hazard handling) (110/110)
<br>
I guess there may be some bugs in my codeü§£. You may need to check carefully when looking at my codes.
<br>
Good luck to all CSers and CEers in CUHK(SZ)!
